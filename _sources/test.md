**Résumé :**
In this paper, we present a linear and reversible programming language with
inductives types and recursion. The semantics of the languages is based on
pattern-matching; we show how ensuring syntactical exhaustivity and
non-overlapping of clauses is enough to ensure reversibility. The language
allows to represent any Primitive Recursive Function. We then give a
Curry-Howard correspondence with the logic $\mu$MALL: linear logic extended
with least fixed points allowing inductive statements. The critical part of our
work is to show how primitive recursion yields circular proofs that satisfy
$\mu$MALL validity criterion and how the language simulates the cut-elimination
procedure of $\mu$MALL.
